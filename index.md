# The Covid Policy Modelling

This project is a collaboration between the University of Edinburgh and Microsoft. It aims to
continue work initiated by GitHub during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide a piece of
infrastructure that would allow different codes that model the pandemic to be run on the same geographical regions, 
where models support this, and to compare the model output results with each other as well as to
real data. For a nice summary of their work see this [document](https://github.com/covid-modeling/covid-model-evaluation/blob/main/how-predictive-are-models-of-covid-19.pdf).
