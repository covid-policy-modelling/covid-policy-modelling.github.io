Throughout this document, commands to type are usually shown in blocks like this:

```bash
$ cat file.txt
This is the contents of the file
```

The `$` indicates a command that you need to type, but you should not type the `$` character itself.
Any lines in a block that do not start with a `$` show the expected output of the command, and should not be typed either.
Blocks may contain more than one command to type, interleaved with output.

Very short commands may be shown inline in a different font, like this: `cat file.txt`.

The same styling is also used when showing the contents of a file, or references to file contents.
In both the output of the commands and while showing repeated file content, some content may be omitted.
This is indicated with an ellipsis: `...`.

Many commands or instructions require information specific to you, e.g. your GitHub username.
These are written in capital letters and surrounded by angle brackets, e.g. `<USERNAME>`.
Always replace these with the appropriate information (which should be clear from context).
For example, if your GitHub username was **octocat**, then an instruction to enter the command `git clone https://github.com/<USERNAME>/tutorial-model-connector.git` means that you should enter `git clone https://github.com/octocat/tutorial-model-connector.git`.
